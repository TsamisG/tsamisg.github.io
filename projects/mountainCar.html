			<h1>MountainCar - Q Value Approximation & SARSA</h1>
				<p>In this mini-project, the OpenAI's MountainCar Gym environment is solved using
					a Linear Regression model -enhanced with RBF Kernels- to approximate the Q-Value.
					SARSA is used as the Learning algorithm.</p>
				<p> In this OpenAI's Gym environment, a car is stochastically placed at the bottom of a
					sinusoidal valley, with the only possible actions being the accelerations
					that can be applied to the car in either direction. The goal is for the car the reach
					the top of the right hill. The acceleration of the car is less than the one required
					to climb the hill. Thus, the agent has to accelerate the car back and fourth strategically,
					in order to use the car's momentum to climb the right hill. The Discrete version of MountainCar
					is used.<br />

			<h2>Analysis and Design</h2>
				<h3>The Environment</h3>
					<p>In the MountainCar environment, the agent is tasked to control the car. The state space contains
						the x-position of the car and its linear velocity:
						$$S = \{ pos, vel \}$$
						The position is bounded in \( [-1.2, 0.6] \) and the velocity is bounded in \( [-0.07, 0.07] \)
						(units in SI).<br />
						The agent's possible actions are three discrete: accelerate to the left (0), don't accelerate (1)
						and accelerate to the right (2):
						$$A = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}$$
						The goal is for the agent to move the car to the top of the right hill, which is positioned
						at \( x=0.5 \). When the car reaches the goal, the episode is terminated.<br />
						Each episode's reward is calculated as such: at each time step the agent receives -1 reward. Thus,
						the sooner the agent reaches the goal, the higher the total reward it receives.
					</p>

					<h3>The Q-Value Approximation Model</h3>
					<p>In order to implement a learning algorithm that will train the agent, a function that maps the state
						and the action to the expected return (the Q-Value) is required. As the agent's actions are discrete,
						a Linear Regression Model is used for each action; each model maps the state to a value for its
						action. Preceding the Linear Regression models, a standard scaler is used to scale the state and
						a set of RBF Kernels is used to transform the scaled state. The purpose is to allow the linear models
						to capture the state space's non-linearities. To be more specific:
						<ul>
							<li>The state is standard scaled.</li>
							<li>The scaled state is transformed into a vector of feature values, using RBF Kernels.</li>
							<li>The feature values are fed into the Linear Regression models.</li>
							<li>Each model's output is the Q-Value for the input state and the model's action.</li>
						</ul>
						<br />
						<figure>
						<img src="/images/mountainCar/diagram1.png"/>
							<figcaption>Fig. 1 - Block Diagram of the Q Value Approximation Model.</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<br />
					</p>
					<p>
						Before the training session begins, a number of state samples is gathered. This can be achieved by
						utilizing the environment's observation_space.sample() method, which returns a random state. This method
						is called until the number of samples is the desired one. This is achieved using the gather_samples_s
						method in cell [3], which is called in cell [5].
						<br />
						<br />
						The standard scaler and the RBF Kernels are fit onto the samples, meaning the scaler computes the mean
						and the standard deviation and a predefined number of sample points are chosen as the feature exemplars
						for the RBF Kernels.
						The number of RBF Kernels and their gamma values are hyperparameters to be chosen during the model's design
						processes. As in most cases, the designer has to experiment with different settings to find the optimal
						set of values. In this case, two RBF Kernels are used with gamma values:
						\( \{ \gamma _1 = 1, \gamma _2 = 0.5 \} \).
						<br />
						<br />
						The linear model presented in <a href="linearRegression.html">"Linear Regression Model in Python"</a>
						is implemented three times; one for each discrete action. The weights are zero-initialized as Optimistic
						Initial Values. To elaborate: zero initial weights and bias produce a zero output. As the expected
						return of each state and action combination is negative (as the rewards are always negative), the
						zero-weights initialization is optimistic (outputs higher Q-Values than expected). This helps the
						convergence of the learning procedure. The Standard Scaler, the Featurizer (set of RBF Kernels) and
						the Linear Regression models are instanced in cell [6].
					</p>
					<h3>The Learning Algorithm - SARSA</h3>
					<p>
						The SARSA algorithm is implemented for the agent's learning. For this project, SARSA is prefered
						in comparison to Q-Learning, as SARSA offers more opportunities for exploration. The exploration element
						is crucial in the MountainCar environment, as the goal is difficult to reach by the initially untrained
						agent. SARSA implements the following Q-Value update, implemented using Stochastic Gradient Descent:
						<div class="container" style="height: 5em; width: 100%;">
						$$ Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha (r + \gamma Q(s_2, a_2) - Q(s,a)) $$
						</div>
						The agent chooses the next action using the Epsilon-Greedy policy of the argmax of the Q-Values of the
						state, over the three possible actions. The Epsilon-Greedy policy helps the agent explore new combinations
						of states and actions.
						<br />
						<br />
						At each training episode, the environment is reset. Then, at each agent's step, the three linear models
						predict a Q-Value corresponding to the state. The argmax of the predictions over the actions is used
						in the Epsilon-Greedy method to choose the next action. The agent takes a step in the environment using
						the selected action. By obtaining the step's reward, the return is calculated and the algorithm takes
						a gradient step to update the corresponding model's parameters (weights and bias). This procedure is
						repeated for the number of training episodes. The learning procedure is implemented in cell [7].
					</p>

					<h3>Hyperparameter Selection</h3>
					<p>
						As in most machine learning problems, the hyperparameters' tuning problem is posed. For this case,
						the algorithm's designer may approach the solution by experimenting with different hyperparameter values.
						The settings used in this case are briefly presented below:
						<ul>
							<li>Maximum Steps per Episode: Set to 1000. This value should not be too small, as the agent has to
								be able to experiment with different actions. If each episode ends too fast, the
								agent will not be able to learn.</li>
							<li>Number of Samples: Set to 200000. A small sample size will lead to poor scaler and featurizer.
								A large sample size may be uneccessary and computationally heavy.</li>
							<li>Number of Features per RBF Kernel: Set to 10. Has to be large enough to capture the state-space's
								non-linearities. Large values lead to heavier Linear Regression models.</li>
							<li>Number of Training Episodes: Set to 200. The training episodes have to be enough to let
								the agent train. Values higher than needed will lead to uneccessary long training sessions.</li>
							<li>Discount Factor - \( \gamma \): Set to 0.99. This should be set close to 1, as
								the agent should be trained to place emphasis on long-term rewards (the total reward).</li>
							<li>Epsilon-Greedy Value - \( \epsilon \): Set to 0.1. This corresponds to a 10%
								chance that the agent chooses an action randomly. This typical value offers a good
								exploration-exploitation balance for this case.</li>
							<li>Learning Rate - \( \alpha \): Set to 0.01. Small learning rates will lead to longer training
								sessions, as Stochastic Gradient Descent is used. Large learning rates will lead to overshooting
								and missing the minimum.</li>
						</ul>

				<h2>Results and Final Thoughts</h2>
				<p>The trained agent is tested in a new environment (See cell [10] above). During the testing
					episode, the agent chooses the next action greedily, using the argmax of the estimated Q Values. The
					Epsilon-Greedy policy is not needed in the testing episode as there is no need for exploration, as the
					agent's model will not be updated.
					The agent achieves the goal
					while obtaining a Reward of -84. This means it reached the goal in 84 time steps, which is satisfactory.
					The result is displayed in the animation below. The animation is created by saving the frame of each step in
					cell [10]. The frames are then saved into a gif file using the Pillow library in cell [11].
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="/images/mountainCar/MountainCarTesting.gif"/>
					<figcaption>Fig. 2 - The agent's performance in a testing episode.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<br />
				<p>As the reward-per-episode plot is choppy due to the stochasticity of the agent's spawn
					and the epsilon-greedy policy, the running average reward plot is prefered. In addition, the goal is to train
					the agent to have a better "average" performance, meaning that in some episodes, the agent may perform
					better than others. Thus, the running average reward plot contains more useful information
					than the reward-per-episode plot. As it is shown, the average reward of the agent increases during
					the training.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="/images/mountainCar/runningAvg.png" style="height: 20em"/>
					<figcaption>Fig. 3 - The running average reward over the training episodes.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<br />

				<p>An interesting plot is displayed below; the action of the agent
					based on the state (created in the cells [12] and [13]). This is usually impossible to plot, as
					in most cases the state is composed of more than two states. However, in this case the state consists
					only of the car's x-position and its velocity. To create this plot, the argmax of the Q-Values for a
					grid of states is stored in a matrix, which is then visualized using the imshow command of the pyplot package.
					Each color corresponds to a different action (3 discrete actions in this case). As it is displayed,
					most of the actions of the agent make sense; for example, the agent pushes the car to the right for positive
					x-positions and positive velocity. However, some actions are not optimal; for example, the agent pushes
					the car to the right for zero x-position and negative or zero velocity. This may lead to the agent getting
					stuck in a scenario where the car is positioned on the bottom of the right hill with zero velocity trying
					to accelerate the car to the right, for which the car's torque is not enough. 
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="/images/mountainCar/actionState.png" style="height: 20em"/>
					<figcaption>Fig. 4 - The model's perception of the best action based on the state.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<br />
				<p>Another useful plot is the visualization of the Value of each state V(s). However,
					the Cost-to-Go value (equivalent to -V(s)) is prefered in this case as it dispays the number of steps
					the agent estimates it needs to reach the goal. This is true for this case as at each time step the agent
					receives -1 reward. Thus, -V(s), which is the negative estimated value of each state, corresponds to the
					number of steps the agent needs to complete the task. As it can be seen in the contour plot below, for positions
					close to the goal (positioned at 0.5), the estimated number of steps for completion is small; especially when the
					velocity is high. The maximum number of steps for completion lies around the agent's spawn point: with position
					around -0.4 and zero velocity.
				</p>

					<figcaption>Fig. 5 - Contour plot of the Cost-to-Go values i.e. the number of steps required at each
						state to reach the goal state.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<br />
				<p>Overall, the presented algorithm trains the agent to solve the given environment succesfully.
					Using two RBF Kernels and a Linear Regression model for each discrete action, the agent is trained in only
					200 episodes. This is a good example of how powerful Linear models with RBF Kernels (also known as RBF
					Networks) can be in solving non-linear problems.
